## "I have seen an increase in plant health especially when late season stress can start to limit yields of crops"

*I first started using Agrigro six years ago.*  I heard about their products from a friend and was interested in soil health and improving the efficiency of nutrient uptake.  The trials that I had seen looked promising.

The crew from Agrigro were interested in my operation and dove into my soil tests to see where their products would be most effective. They came up with common sense protocols that were easy to implement.

Since I started using Agrigro I have seen an increase in plant health especially when late season stress can start to limit yields of crops.  My canola has been able to hang on longer and fight disease and insects that would decimate previous crops. 

I have been pleased with the look and yield from the Agrigro applied crops.  I look forward to seeing how much more we can do.
